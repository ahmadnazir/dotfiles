## Todo:

### Emacs

#### Shell
- Open shells easily. I lost this functionality because the file wasn't under version control.
  Refer to [Super user question: Directly open remote shell with tramp in emacs](http://superuser.com/a/905060/413325)
- Interaction with docker containers

##### Window Commands
- On saving, go in vi 'normal mode'

##### Package Management
- Keep a list of packages that the emacs configurations depend on

### Misc
- A script is required that creates symlinks in the home folder for all the files/folders present in the top level of this repo. As an example, see [Using Git And Github To Manage Your Dotfiles](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)
