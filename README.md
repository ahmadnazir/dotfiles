## Todo:

### Emacs

#### Shell
- Open shells easily. I lost this functionality because the file wasn't under version control.
  Refer to [Super user question: Directly open remote shell with tramp in emacs](http://superuser.com/a/905060/413325)
- Interaction with docker containers

#### Visual
- Toggle between different font sizes
- Toggle between selected themes

##### Window Commands
- On saving, go in vi 'normal mode'

### Misc
- A script is required that creates symlinks in the home folder for all the files/folders present in the top level of this repo
